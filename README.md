# bounded_lph 
Use hashing to reduce dimensionality of bounded values.
This is useful for searching and aggregating across all dimensions. 

This algorithm is a general purpose abstraction of geohashing. 
We can employ the same method of locality preserving hashing in many other low dimensionality problems (e.g. colors)
